Cplex Server Setup
- Create new GCP Instance with enough memory
- Pull cplex_server repo from github
- Install Java (default-jre)
- Install cplex (might have to run export PS1=">" and do installation from that terminal)
- export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/anushreeagrawal/CPLEX_Studio128/opl/bin/x86-64_linux/
- ./opl/bin/x86-64_linux/oplrun should work
